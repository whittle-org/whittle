    See ``litgpt finetune lora``.

    Creates a new ``lit_model.pth`` file by merging the LoRA weights (``lit_model.pth.lora``)
    with the original checkpoint weights.

    Arguments:
        checkpoint_dir: Path to the checkpoint directory with trained LoRA weights, which is the output of
            ``litgpt finetune lora``.
        pretrained_checkpoint_dir: Optional path to the checkpoint directory with the weights of the base model
            corresponding to the LoRA checkpoint. By default, this will automatically be inferred from the metadata
            in the given `checkpoint_dir` directory. Only set this if the base model's checkpoint directory
            has moved or was renamed.
        precision: Optional precision setting to instantiate the model weights in. By default, this will
            automatically be inferred from the metadata in the given ``checkpoint_dir`` directory.
