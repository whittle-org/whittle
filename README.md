Whittle is a Python library for compressing large language models (LLMs) 
by extracting sub-networks to balance performance and efficiency. It is based on [LitGPT](https://github.com/Lightning-AI/litgpt)
and allows to compress many state-of-the-art models.


- **Neural Architecture Search:** Workflows for [pre-training super-networks](whittle/pretrain_super_network.py) and multi-objective search to select sub-networks.
- **Evaluation**: Easy extraction of sub-networks checkpoint and evaluation using LM-Eval-Harness
- **Efficiency**: Different metrics to estimate efficiency of sub-networks, such as latency, FLOPs, or energy consumption.
